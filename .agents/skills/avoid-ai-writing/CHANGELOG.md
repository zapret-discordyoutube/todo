## [3.16.0] — 2026-07-15

### Added
- **"load-bearing" (metaphor) to Tier 1 word table** — LLMs, especially Claude, use "load-bearing" as a portable label for any dependency the argument rests on: "load-bearing assumption," "load-bearing claim," "load-bearing test," "load-bearing invariant." Added to both the SKILL.md Tier 1 table and the detector engine as a `TIER1_PHRASES` entry. Matches the hyphenated compound only — unhyphenated "load bearing" is ordinary English ("the load bearing down on the bridge"). Construction carve-out: literal uses before a structural noun (`wall`, `beam`, `column`, `joist`, `truss`, `member`, `footing`, `slab`, `stud`, `partition`, `masonry`, `lintel`, `pier`, `rafter`, `girder`, `capacity`) are exempt, including with one material or position adjective in between (`load-bearing structural wall`). Abstract-capable nouns (`structure`, `element`, `frame`, `foundation`) are excluded from the carve-out on purpose, so the metaphor still fires on them. Known gap: predicative use ("the wall is load-bearing") still flags — carve-out design tracked in #56. Replacement: essential, critical, necessary — or say what breaks if you remove it.

## [3.15.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Wall-of-text replies** — reply-length text (roughly under 150 words, four or more sentences) delivered as one unbroken paragraph with no line breaks anywhere, the shape LLMs default to in conversational registers (issue/PR comments, chat, DMs, casual email) where humans instead break at thought boundaries. Catalog goes from 51 to 52 detection categories. LLM-judgment rule, not a detector `type`: a first pass implemented it as a structural gate (reply-length + sentence floor + zero newlines) and it broke the "repeated Tier 1 phrase does not inflate score linearly" fixture on review — turned out "one paragraph, no internal line break" is just what an ordinary short paragraph looks like, not an AI-specific shape, so an unconditional detector would fire on routine human prose. Reverted per the precision-over-recall principle in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; documented in `detector/CATEGORIES.md` §C with the reasoning.
- **Recap-flattery opener** — replying to a person by summarizing their own work back at them with praise before getting to the point ("Thanks for all the legwork here — the X and Y you worked through are what made Z possible"). The reader already knows what they did; the recap performs appreciation instead of conveying information. Catalog goes from 52 to 53 detection categories. LLM-judgment rule (no detector `type` — the tell is redundancy with information the reader already holds, which requires reading both sides of an exchange, not a fixed phrase).

### Changed
- **Formatting** — extended the curly-quotes weak-signal tier with **immaculate typography in casual registers**: perfect spacing, punctuation, and capitalization in a context humans type fast (comments, chat) is corroborating evidence, never conclusive alone. Also flags the inverse: when editing a human's casual text, preserve their typos — smoothing them away erases the fingerprint that marks the text as theirs. LLM-judgment rule; folded into the existing Formatting section (same tier as curly quotes), no new category.
- Cursor port (`cursor-rules/avoid-ai-writing.mdc`) caught up from v3.12.0 to v3.15.0: ported the 3.13.0 (speculative scenario openers, "deeply" conditional Tier 2, multi-negation countdown, invented concept labels, historical analogy stacking) and 3.14.0 (vague third-party validation) rule changes it had missed, plus this release's three additions.

### Source
- Observed in the wild: a maintainer on a GitHub issue flagged an assisted-sounding reply with "I prefer to talk human to human." The block-paragraph shape and the recap of the maintainer's own prior work were the tells, not any single word. Name and repo withheld.

---

## [3.14.0] — 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Vague third-party validation** — manufacturing credibility by pointing at an *unnamed* external authority, usually with a generic superlative ("an outside party measuring the same models everyone runs and putting us on top," "independent testing confirms," "analysts agree"). The authority is faceless and the claim unfalsifiable, so the reader can't tell who measured what or go check. The inverse of **Notability name-dropping** (which over-names *specific* prestigious sources); a passage can run both moves at once. Carve-out: specifically attributed, checkable validation — a named benchmark, a linked report, a dated audit — stays unflagged, since the tell is the vagueness, not the citation. Catalog goes from 50 to 51 detection categories. LLM-judgment rule (no detector `type`); listed in `detector/CATEGORIES.md` §C. Addresses #39 (the follow-up half raised by @hiSandog).

---

## [3.13.0] — 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Speculative scenario openers** — the LLM habit of opening an argument with a hypothetical that lists desirable outcomes instead of making a claim: "Imagine a world where…", "Picture a future in which…", "Envision a world where…", including the comma-interrupted "Imagine, for a moment, a world where…" cadence. The scenario does the persuading; no evidence is offered. New detection category (49 → 50) and a `speculative-opener` detector `type` (44 → 45). Gated to the world/future/reality object plus where/in-which, so instructional "imagine you have a sorted array" and analytical "consider a scenario where…" stay clean. Known accepted false positive: fiction openings and staged thought experiments also match; the skill's carve-out handles that judgment, and a lone hit cannot flip a document's classification. Source: tropes.fyi ("Imagine a World Where…").
- **"deeply" as a conditional Tier 2 word** — one of the "magic adverbs" AI uses to inflate mundane descriptions. Stricter than standard Tier 2: "deeply" only counts toward a cluster in its significance collocations ("deeply integrated," "deeply committed," "deeply rooted"), because bare "deeply" is everyday English — adversarial testing showed an unconditional entry flags clean human prose ("deeply nested JSON… crucial") and can tip an otherwise-borderline human document across a classification boundary. Literal uses never count, in any company. Source: tropes.fyi ("Quietly" and Other Magic Adverbs).

### Changed
- **"It's not X — it's Y" contrastive rule** — extended to name the **multi-negation countdown** ("It's not the price. It's not the features. It's the trust."), the same reveal move inflated across several negated options. LLM-judgment rule; no new category. Source: tropes.fyi ("Not X. Not Y. Just Z.").
- **Novelty inflation** — extended to flag **invented concept labels**: pseudo-analytical compound terms coined mid-sentence and never defined ("the supervision paradox," "a coordination tax"). Naming a concept is not explaining it. LLM-judgment rule; no new category. Source: tropes.fyi ("Invented Concept Labels").
- **Notability name-dropping** — extended with a related-pattern note on **historical analogy stacking**: rapid-fire lists of past technologies or companies to borrow their weight ("like the printing press, the telegraph, and the internet before it"). LLM-judgment rule; no new category. Source: tropes.fyi ("Historical Analogy Stacking").

Trope review sourced from [tropes.fyi/directory](https://tropes.fyi/directory) and its [tropes-md digest](https://tropes.fyi/tropes-md), with thanks to the [tropes.fyi markdown gist](https://gist.github.com/ossa-ma/f3baa9d25154c33095e22272c631f5a1) by ossa-ma. Most of the 33 catalogued tropes were already covered; this release adds the gaps that survived a false-positive review.

---

## [3.12.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- **"quietly" to Tier 2 word table** — AI uses "quietly" as a significance adverb to imply underdog credibility without evidence: "quietly building," "quietly reshaping," "quietly becoming." On its own in a sentence it's fine; in a paragraph already leaning on other Tier 2 words it's a cluster tell. Added to both the SKILL.md Tier 2 table and the detector engine. The detector fires when "quietly" appears alongside one other Tier 2 word in the same paragraph. Replacement: cut the adverb, or name the concrete contrast. Source: tropes.fyi/tropes ("Quietly" and Other Magic Adverbs).

---

## [3.11.0] — 2026-07-05

### Changed
- **"It's not X — it's Y" contrastive rule** — broadened to name the **split-sentence variant**, where the negation and the correction land in two separate sentences ("The headline isn't the speed. The real story is Y.") rather than pivoting on a single dash or comma. The joined form was the rule's implicit template, so the two-sentence split — which reads as two innocent declaratives — was slipping through. Same move, now flagged. LLM-judgment rule; catalog stays at 49 categories. Addresses #39.

---

## [3.10.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **List-label periods** — in bulleted lists where each item leads with a short label, LLMs end the label with a period and run the gloss as a separate sentence, where a person almost always uses a colon. Strongest with bold labels (`**Intros.**` vs `**Intros:**`); the unbolded shape (`- Intros. Years of...`) is the same tell, slightly weaker. The colon reads as "here's what this label means"; the period reads as a sentence the next clause then contradicts by continuing. Fix is to swap the period for a colon and lowercase the gloss, or drop the bold label entirely. Distinct from inline-header lists (bold headers that repeat the point): this rule is about the punctuation on the label, not the redundancy. Carve-out: a bold span that is a full standalone sentence keeps its period. Catalog goes from 48 to 49 detection categories. LLM-judgment rule (no detector `type`). Closes #31.

---

## [3.9.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Social endorsement closers** — the curatorial sign-off LLMs append to LinkedIn/X share posts, usually a colon teeing up a link: "This one is worth your time:", "This one's a must-read:", "Do yourself a favor and read this," "You won't want to miss this one," "Thank me later," "Bookmark this," "Don't sleep on this one." Performs a recommendation without giving the reader a reason to click. Distinct from the bare "worth [verb]ing" word-table entry (a single weak word inside a sentence) and from infomercial engagement hooks (mid-flow teasers) — this is the whole closing line of a social post. Demonstrative-anchored ("THIS one is worth your time") so it stays off plain human endorsements ("the book is worth reading, but the middle drags"). Catalog goes from 47 to 48 detection categories; the detector engine gains a `social-cta-closer` `type` (43 → 44). Closes #29.

---

## [3.8.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Self-labeling significance** — back-pointing labels that flag which item in a list is supposed to matter ("That last move is the contrarian one," "This is the interesting part," "That third bullet is the real story") instead of writing the list so the right item carries the weight on its own. Distinct from confidence calibration (which front-loads the cue) and emotional flatline (which prefaces a single claim) — this one back-points after the fact. Catalog goes from 46 to 47 detection categories. LLM-judgment rule (no detector `type`); documented in `detector/CATEGORIES.md` §C.

---

## [3.7.2] — 2026-05-28

### Changed
- **Curly quotation marks** — recalibrated per review of #15. Reframed from a "strong" tell to a **weak, corroborating** signal meaningful mainly in plain-text contexts (code comments, commit messages, plaintext drafts), since Word/Google Docs/macOS/iOS auto-curl quotes by default. Curly apostrophes (U+2019) are no longer flagged on their own (they appear in every contraction). Fixes the German low-9 example. Keeps it consistent with the deterministic detector's co-occurrence logic (#16).

---

## [3.7.1] — 2026-05-28

### Changed
- **Curly quotation marks** — refined the 3.7.0 "mixed straight/curly punctuation" rule into a single Formatting rule: flag the unexplained presence of Unicode curly quotes (U+201C / U+201D / U+2018 / U+2019) in otherwise plain-ASCII text as a copy-paste-from-chat fingerprint, with carve-outs for deliberate publication typography and locale-correct punctuation (French guillemets, German low-9 quotes).
- Version bump to 3.7.1.

- Contributed by [@augustasas](https://github.com/augustasas) (#15).

---
## [3.7.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added
- **Hyphenated-pair overuse** — stacked compound modifiers ("a high-quality, well-architected, future-proof solution") and the attributive/predicate error (hyphenate "a high-quality report" but not "the report is high quality").
- **Speculative gap-filling** — hedged speculation dressed as background ("maintains a low profile," "is believed to have," "likely began his career") that hides a knowledge gap rather than admitting it. Distinct from cutoff disclaimers.

### Changed
- **Formatting** — added **mixed straight/curly punctuation** (quote/apostrophe style mixed in one document — a paste-from-chat-UI tell).
- **Confidence calibration phrases** — extended with **persuasive-authority tropes** ("the real question is," "at its core," "fundamentally," "make no mistake").
- Version bump to 3.7.0.

### Credit
- Patterns adapted from `blader/humanizer` (P21, P26, P27) and Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing," identified in the competitive research tracked in #22.

---

## [3.6.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added
- **Voice profiles** — an optional persona axis, independent of the audience context profiles. Five profiles (`casual`, `professional`, `technical`, `warm`, `blunt`), each a set of concrete targets (sentence length, contraction policy, hedging tolerance, jargon level, rhythm) drawn from writing-craft sources (Strunk, Provost, Ogilvy, Handley). Plus optional calibration to a user-supplied writing sample. Includes a composition rule: voice sets the target, context sets enforcement strictness, conflicts resolve toward the stricter.
- **Edit mode** — a third mode alongside `rewrite` and `detect`. Edits a named file in place via the Edit tool with minimal, targeted changes, preserving already-human passages, then re-reads to verify. Returns an edits-made + verification report, not the full file.
- **Iterate to convergence** — rewrite mode can repeat the audit→rewrite cycle until no patterns remain or N passes (capped at 2). Generalizes the existing built-in second pass.
- **Invocation surface** — documented optional flags (`--mode`, `--voice`, `--context`, `--file`, `--iterate N`) alongside the existing natural-language triggers.

### Changed
- Frontmatter `description` updated to advertise the new modes and voice profiles.
- Version bump to 3.6.0.

### Notes
- Designed from a competitive feature audit (Aboudjem/humanizer-skill, brandonwise/humanizer, blader/humanizer) plus detection-science and writing-craft research. The `--score` feature and four additional catalog patterns from that research are tracked separately (#21, #22).

---

## [3.5.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Infomercial engagement hooks** — punchy fragment-hooks that fake momentum around ordinary information: "The catch?", "The kicker?", "Here's the thing.", "Plot twist:", "The best part?". Distinct from rhetorical-question openers (which stall before a point) and chatbot artifacts (which perform helpfulness).
- **Paragraph-reshuffle immunity** — a writer-side structure test: if you can swap two body paragraphs without breaking the piece, you've written a list of points, not an argument that builds.
- **Treadmill effect / low information density** — a writer-side content test: each paragraph should contribute one new fact, claim, or turn rather than restate the premise in fresh words. The tell is that you could cut 40-60% and lose no information.

### Changed
- **Superficial -ing analyses** — extended to cover the declarative "meaning-telling" variant ("this represents a broader shift," "speaks to a larger trend") that glosses a mundane subject as profound without the -ing construction.
- Version bump to 3.5.0.

### Credit
- Patterns adapted from [`Aboudjem/humanizer-skill`](https://github.com/Aboudjem/humanizer-skill) (P38, P40, P41, P43), identified during a competitive catalog audit.

## [3.4.0] — 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Tier 3 phrases** — multi-word boilerplate that's individually unobjectionable but stacks heavily in AI-generated crypto/web3/DePIN/AI-infra content: `emerging sector`, `the integration of`, `the intersection of`, `community-driven`, `long-term sustainability`, `user engagement`, `decentralized compute`, `sustainable reward emissions`, `tokenized incentive structures`, `designed for long-term`. Flagged by per-phrase density (≥2 repetitions) *or* cluster (≥3 distinct phrases in one piece — the LLM-varies-its-own-boilerplate shape).
- **Generic future-narrative closers** — "May become one of the most important narratives of the next market cycle" template family. Modal + "become" + (one of) the most + (narrative / story / trend / theme / chapter / movement).
- **Hedge-stacked predictions** — `could potentially`, `may eventually`, `might ultimately`. Modal + hedge adverb stack where each word cancels the next.
- **"Real/actual" adjective inflation** — `real on-chain tokenomics`, `actual reward sustainability`, `genuine utility`, `true product-market fit`. The noun-modifier form distinct from the existing sentence-level hollow-intensifier rule.
- **Hashtag stuffing** — trailing blocks of 6+ hashtags on short posts, especially when mixing one project tag with broad category tags (#AI #Crypto #Web3 #Innovation #FutureTech).
- **Bullet lists of bare noun phrases** — 5+ consecutive bullets where each is a short adj+noun pair with no verb. Detector heuristic excludes genuine list content (verbs in items, ingredient lists, changelog entries).

### Changed
- **Emotional flatline** — extended to cover the bare section-header variant: "Interesting part of the project:" / "Interesting thing here:" — same role as "the most interesting part" but as a header opener.
- **Severity tiers** — all six new categories wired into P0/P1/P2 ladder (hashtag stuffing varies by profile; the rest are P1, with phrase repetition at P2).
- **Context profiles tolerance matrix** — added rows for all six new categories so the `linkedin` and `docs` profiles don't false-positive on legitimate use (e.g., bullet-NP lists relaxed on `technical-blog` and `docs` since technical option lists are correctly bare-NP).
- **"6+" hashtag threshold** — added rationale paragraph explaining the empirical floor.
- **"Real/actual" inflation** — added named-contrast carve-out so honest contrastive writing ("real on-chain settlement, not bridged IOUs") isn't flagged.
- Version bump to 3.4.0.

### Reported by
- A user of the avoid-ai-writing extension flagged two crypto-shill social posts (MineBench reviews) that the v3.3.x wordlist+regex detector scored as "Minimal AI signals" despite being obvious LLM output. Both posts avoided every Tier 1 vocabulary entry by substituting synonyms ("emerging sector," "scalable network contribution," "viability") and used structural shapes (hashtag block, bare-NP bullet lists, hedge stacks, future-narrative templates) the detector had no rule for. v3.4 adds rules for the structures, not just the words.

---

## [3.3.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **"Worth [verb]ing" vague endorsement pattern**: `worth reading`, `worth paying attention to`, `worth a look`, `worth exploring`, `worth checking out`, `worth your time` — broadens existing "it's worth noting that" to the full family
- **Reader-steering frames**: `Here's what's interesting`, `Here's what caught my eye`, `Here's what stood out` — added to both transition phrases and confidence calibration sections with context on when the pattern is a genuine problem vs. when data-backed usage is acceptable

### Changed
- Version bump to 3.3.0

---

## [3.2.0] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Detect mode**: flag-only mode that identifies AI patterns without rewriting. Trigger with "detect," "flag only," "audit only," "just flag," "scan," or similar. Returns issues grouped by severity (P0/P1/P2) plus an assessment of which flags are clear problems vs. judgment calls. Useful when flagged patterns are intentional, when auditing published or third-party content, or when you want a quick scan without a full rewrite.

### Changed
- Output format section now documents both rewrite (default) and detect mode outputs
- Version bump to 3.2.0

---

## [3.1.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- 3 new Tier 1 words from Pangram AI detection research: `keen` (as intensifier), `symphony` (metaphor), `embrace` (metaphor)
- 2 new template phrases: "Whether you're X or Y" (false-breadth), "I recently had the pleasure of" (review/social AI pattern)
- "In summary" added to transition phrases (alongside existing "In conclusion" / "To summarize")
- Structure-priority note in Rhythm section: structural regularity is the #1 signal AI detectors weight, above vocabulary
- Over-polishing warning: aggressive editing can push writing toward AI statistical profiles by removing natural disfluency

### Changed
- Total vocabulary: 106 → 109 entries (60 Tier 1 + 38 Tier 2 + 11 Tier 3)
- Template phrases: 2 → 4 entries

### Source
- Pangram Labs AI detection research (pangram.com) — decoder-only classifier trained on 28M human documents. Key insight: structural uniformity and pacing consistency are weighted higher than individual word choices.

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Tiered vocabulary system** — words are now organized into three tiers based on AI-signal strength:
  - Tier 1 (always flag): 53 entries — dead giveaways that appear 5–20x more often in AI text
  - Tier 2 (flag in clusters): 38 entries — legitimate words that signal AI when 2+ appear in the same paragraph
  - Tier 3 (flag by density): 11 entries — common words that only flag when the text is saturated with them
- 39 new vocabulary entries across all tiers, including: bustling, intricate, complexities, ever-evolving, daunting, holistic, actionable, impactful, learnings, thought leadership, best practices, synergy, interplay, encompass, catalyze, reimagine, galvanize, augment, cultivate, illuminate, elucidate, juxtapose, paradigm-shifting, transformative, cornerstone, paramount, poised, burgeoning, nascent, quintessential, overarching, underpinning, significant, innovative, dynamic, scalable, compelling, unprecedented, sophisticated, instrumental, world-class
